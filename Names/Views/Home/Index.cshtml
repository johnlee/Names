        <h2>About EREUM</h2>

        <p>
          <b>EREUM</b> is <i>Korean</i> for <b>name</b>. This is an app designed
          <b>
            <i>
              <span style='color:#ED7D31'>to help people who have trouble remembering names.</span>
            </i>
          </b>
          This is one of my personal challenges and I've tried a variety of ways to solve
          the problem. It's difficult and I have only met a couple of people that
          were good at it, but I forgot their names!
        </p>

        <p>
          I use to write names on my phone as contacts. But contacts are more for known people with information on how to get a hold of them.
          Also there was nothing else I could store about them that would help me remember them. I needed to write down attributes about the person,
          things that would help me remember them (look at tips below).
          So I tried writing names and descriptions in various other places but over time these would get
          lost, disorganized and hard to find.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hence EREUM. This app is allows you to quickly and easily store names and attributes, then easily search that information later. It's also accessible anywhere.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the app you record a name. This could be their full
          name, partial or even a nickname. Doesn't matter. Along with it, jot down any
          descriptions. If you have a photo of the person, go ahead and upload
          that as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          Later, when you need to find their name, search for them
          easily through the navigator using any of the attributes you jotted down, or scroll through the names and photos.
          Over time, if you happen to get closer to this new
          acquaintance, convert the person into an official contact with a single click
          as EREUM will import them to your contacts.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Tips on How to Remember Names</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>1. </strong>Until
          you have a chance to write the name down, <span style='color:#4472C4'>REPEAT </span>it
          to yourself. Repetition is the best way our minds remember things so repeat
          their name in your head, even as you're still talking to them. If you didn't
          hear it correctly the first time, ask them to repeat it, then you say it out
          loud back to them to make sure you got it right. Then let that loop roll in
          your head!
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>2. </strong><span style='color:#4472C4'>Write it down!</span> This will require some spelling
          abilities if it's a name you never heard of before. It's not rude to ask the
          person to spell it out for you if you don't know. But once you got those
          letters, write it down as soon as you get a chance.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>3. </strong>The
          remaining steps are <span style='color:#70AD47'>attributes </span>to <strong>focus</strong> on
          that can help you remember the person. There are many different types of
          attributes you can try to gather.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span style='color:#70AD47'>Appearance</span><br />
          <i>
            What do they look like? What's their race, hair color, eye color, physique?
          </i> Also take note of tatoos,
          piercings, or accessories like glasses. These things can help you recall the person later.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span style='color:#70AD47'>Associate </span><br />
          Try to make connections from that person to other things that you know. <i>Do they look like someone you know or perhaps a celebrity?</i>
          Or maybe something about them reminds you of someone or something. By associating them to something else you already know, you've hard
          wired a connection to that person in your brain!
        </p>

        <p>
          <span style='color:#70AD47'>Narrative </span><br />
          These are other information about the person that can help you remember them as it describes who they are. For example -
          their title, occupation or perhaps some talent. Anything that you think is special about them.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          <b>EREUM</b> helps you recall a persons name based on the attributes above but it only works
          <span style='color:#C55A11'>if you focus on the person!</span>
          You need to concentrate on the name and attributes, get it ingrained into your head as you repeat it.
          If you really want to remember a person, you have to dedicate a bit of time towards them.
